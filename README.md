# HackerRank C Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to HackerRank programming challenges solved in C language.

I created this repo to practice and improve my C programming skills by solving real problems.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g. gcc):
   ```bash
   gcc conditional_statements.c -o conditional_statements
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./conditional_statements
   ```
3. Enter the number when prompted.

## Sample Input/Output

Input:
```
5
```

Output:
```
five
```

Input:
```
44
```

Output:
```
Greater than 9
```

## What I Learned

- How to use conditional statements in C  
- How to read input and print output correctly  
- Importance of matching output format exactly  

## Next Steps

- Practice loops and arrays  
- Solve more HackerRank problems  
- Write cleaner and more efficient code
